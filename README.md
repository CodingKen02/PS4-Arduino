# PS4-Arduino
## MSU Innovate State Hackathon 2023 | My Role: Programmer
This repository displays two codes for the PS4 controller in USB and Bluetooth mode. 

You will have to install Arduino with the USB Host Shield Library 2.0 (I used version 1.62 at the time). 

This code will allow your controller to connect and operate your Arduino/robot's wheels.
